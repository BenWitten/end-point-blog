Marina Lohova talked about her favorite jQuery modules. It was the last talk of the day and she did not have much time.

Her focus was on the functional plugins. Interesting modules that she mentioned include:

- Ajax PayPal Cart
- Sisyphus (uses HTML5 LocalStorage)
- jImpress (presentations)
- jPlayer (HTML5)
- ResponseJS
- lqTouch (adds mobile events like swipe)
