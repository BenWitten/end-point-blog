title: Popular Mobile Apps from Brian and Adam
---

In our last lightning talk of the conference, Brian Dillon and [Adam Vollrath](/team/adam_vollrath) shared some of their favorite mobile apps. Brian queried the room to see the phone type divide in the room. Here was our split: 33% - iPhones, 33% - Androids, 33% - unsmart phones.

Brian likes pure simplicity for iPhone apps:

- [Dropkick](http://dropkickapp.com/), categorization, syncing, require account creation
- [Simplenote](http://www.simplenoteapp.com/): same thing, but for notes

Adam has an Android "because Google owns him":

- [Google Googles](http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles/): Rumored Google technology is integrated into this. Google tries to ad-hoc identify logos, book covers, automatic translation of images, images, QR codes.
- [K9 Mail](http://www.androidtapp.com/k9-mail/): email client
- [Andchat](http://www.andchat.net/): IRC client
- [WiFi Analyzer](http://www.flukenetworks.com/enterprise-network/wireless-network/AirMagnet-WiFi-Analyzer): provides site survey on network traffic
- [SpeedTest](http://www.androidtapp.com/speedtest-net-speed-test/)
