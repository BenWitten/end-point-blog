Today, I gave the presentation to my coworkers entitled "Puppies & Ecommerce as an Engine". The presentation is strongly coupled with my work on [Piggybak](http://www.piggybak.org/), and includes a discussion of traditional ecommerce platforms versus a lightweight ecommerce approach through modularity (Rails Engine). It also provides some code examples as how this does work in Piggybak.
