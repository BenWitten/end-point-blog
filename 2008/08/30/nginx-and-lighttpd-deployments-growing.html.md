title: nginx and lighttpd deployments growing

[Apache httpd](http://httpd.apache.org/) is great. But it's good to see Netcraft report that [nginx](http://nginx.net/) and [lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net/) continue to [grow in popularity](http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2008/08/29/august_2008_web_server_survey.html) as well. Having active competition in the free software web server space is really beneficial to everyone, and these very lightweight and fast servers fill an important niche for dedicated static file serving, homegrown CDNs, etc. Thanks to all the developers involved!
