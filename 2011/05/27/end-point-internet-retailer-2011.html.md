<p style="margin-top:0px;">We're excited to announce that End Point will be in full force at <a href="http://www.irce2011.com/2011/">Internet Retailer 2011</a>. A team of six (Rick, Ben, Jon, Ron, Carl, and myself) will be managing a booth during the 3 day Conference and Exhibition in San Diego from June 14th-17th.</p>

<p>We're hoping to reach out to future clients to discuss our services including ecommerce develpoment and support, database development and support, systems architecture, hosting, and Liquid Galaxy build, maintenance and support. We'll also have a Liquid Galaxy display to show off as part of our exhibit. We have a couple of conference passes so hopefully we'll attend a few sessions and share some details about those sessions here on our blog!</p>
